    "\n",
    "Two sensors are installed in Susquehanna river that can measure the level of the water on two different locations. Their measurements goes through a neural network and the output shows if there is a chance of flood or not (y=1 means there is a chance of flood). Suppose sensor 1 shows 0.4 feet while the second one shows 0.32 feet. Is there any chance of flood?\n",

    "#### Notes for the solution: \n",
    "      1. Please use Python to answer to the question\n",
    "      2. Please generate Random vectors and matrices (using numpy) for weights and bias( seed = 123)\n",
    "      3. Must explain the final result\n",
